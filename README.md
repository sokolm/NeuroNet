NeuroNet
========

The editor tool for creating neural networks and teaching them by algorithm BPTT.

The program allows you to design a neural network architecture arbitrary,
set the parameters of the layers and network connections, to train by the algorithm BPTT
and use trained network in the future.

Exists the posibility to save files in the chart:

     *. nng - file with the network diagram, 
	          if the object network (neural network) is not yet created;
     *. nno - a file with a network entity.
